Instructions - Adding Suits

All suite definitions are in the 'suit-defs.json', this includes details such as each suit's name & if it needs to be unlocked to be used. To add a new suite to your game just follow these steps:

1 - Place your new texture file in the resource folder ('resAdditionalSuits') 2 - Create a new JSON entry in the 'suit-defs.json' file to represent your suit

When you load your game your new suit should be added!
